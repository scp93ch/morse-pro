# morse-pro Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-01-02

No particular reason to make a release now except that it's been too long coming and will never really be ready. Best to release it now in case it is useful to someone. It's version 2.0.0 because of breaking changes, not for any other reason. More breaking changes are likely as I am not happy with the architecture, but who knows when?!

### Added

- more in-line documentation in many files
- some more tests of main classes
- morse-pro
    - a few more punctuation characters
- morse-pro-wpm
    - `dahLength`, `ditSpace`, `charSpace` and `wordSpace` methods
- morse-pro-cw
    - `wordSpace` property
    - `endPadding` parameter (default 0) in `getSample` and `getWAASample` methods to allow a configurable pause at the end of the waveform
- morse-pro-cw-wave
    - a lowpass bi-quad filter to the waveform generated by `getSample`
    - `getWAASample` asynchronous method to return sample generated using Web Audio API
- morse-pro-keyer
    - optional `fwpm` 3rd argument in constructor
- morse-pro-keyer-iambic
    - optional `fwpm` 3rd argument in constructor
    - optional `iambicA` 5th argument in constructor to switch between iambic A and B modes
- morse-pro-player-waa
    - callback functions in constructor for sequenceStart, sequenceEnding and soundStopped (the last one was previously just in `morse-pro-player-waa-light`)
    - low-pass filter on waveform to remove clicks
    - `loadTimings` method
    - `loadNext` method to provide a single item queue of timings
    - `pause` method
    - `isPaused` read-only property
    - `nextNote` read-only property
    - `startPadding` field to insert a pause before playback begins (suggest 5ms to avoid sound artefacts in some browsers)
    - `endPadding` field to insert a pause after playback of a timing sequence completes
- morse-pro-player-waa-light
    - additional callback functions in constructor to match `morse-pro-player-waa`

- morse-pro-wpm
    - millisecond timings are now rounded to the nearest integer
- morse-pro-util-riffwave
